Hi I'm Clint,

A 30 something year old outspoken father, husband, lean enthusiast and aspiring chef. I'm originally from Australia but was roped into now living in Hamburg Germany. I love to try and break things down as clean and simple as possible. To better understand whats going on at the working level, and more importantly what brings the benefit for the end product. Although this drive certainly doesn't always lead to the simplest of paths, I do however think the following quote sums it all up quite well 

> The elevation of short term gains over lasting achievement displays a poverty of ambition. It distracts us from what’s truly important

Be it working on a new recipe in the kitchen or driving operational improvements in business - Adding to an efficient, valued end product is  where my true passion lies. I've set this blog up to act mainly just as a repository of stuff I find interesting - hopefully others find it the same as well. If you would like to connect with me or just have a chat about anything, then feel free to have a look around and get in touch.

Cheers,
