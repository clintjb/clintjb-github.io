In the past few months, we've been discussing that we will need a second car, mainly due to some new working arrangements. As I've always had a soft-spot for original (Pre-BMW) Minis, I thought now would be as good a time as any to bite the bullet and get one. 

Growing up, we always had cars around the house, and its one of my few regrets I never really learnt how to work on an engine. I'm certain I've "romanticized" the notion in my head a little, but I particularly wanted a Mini as I really want to do most the work myself and restore/maintain it by learning the things from head to toe.

So over the past few months, I've been looking all over Europe and finally found one in the Netherlands - we headed across last weekend. Although it certainly had some rust, it seemed nothing too substantial so I bought it and drove it drove it back the 400kms or so on the Autobahn - it drove perfectly and never skipped a beat... Mechanically it seems quite good but will only know for sure after the TÜV inspection this weekend.

Having a better look over it this week I've taken some photos of all the rust spots I've found - nothing ridiculous but work to be done. Paints OK, but far from great when you look up close.

Its interior really needs some work - it's missing a headliner / seats aren't great / stereo doesn't work and noisy as hell. 

The cars definitely a head turner and I'm absolutely loving when I take it out for a drive. Nevertheless, I think the best way to sum this car up at the moment would be "good from far but far from good"

So that's about it; if everything goes well with the TÜV this weekend than its time to put that excitement to good use and really start fixing it up. 

I'll use this section of the page as a bit of a working journal for the car and where I go from here.

Cheers
