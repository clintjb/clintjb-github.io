Brian Kesinger, a story artist for Marvel and Disney Animation Studios, is a fan of both the Saturday morning comic and the famous sci-fi franchise, so he found an incredibly cute way to pay homage to both after seeing Star Wars: The Force Awakens. 

You can find Brian over here on his [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/briankesinger/) account.
