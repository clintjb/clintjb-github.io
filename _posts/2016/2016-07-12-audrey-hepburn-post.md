She was spontaneous right from her first major role in "Roman Holiday," played sly comedy in "Sabrina" and showed a range of feeling in "Breakfast at Tiffany's." There's something really charming about the lady that's impossible to put your finger on.

With that said, I really quite like these illustrations and find they capture her and that charm quite well.

Cheers,
