She was spontaneous right from her first major role in "Roman Holiday," played sly comedy in "Sabrina" and showed a range of feeling in "Breakfast at Tiffany's." There's something incredibly charming about the lady that's impossible to put your finger on.

I really quite like all these illustrations and find they capture her and that spark quite well.

Cheers,
