So these are a few of those little things that I've built into my daily routine that I find I now couldn't live without. Most of them are answers to some of my own personal weaknesses; so some may or may not be relevant to you. Either way, give me a shout though if you find any interesting or have some of your own to share.

### Reflection
Quite often there's some kind of the personal point I want to focus more on and develop myself. I'll read a book or an article and find a little snippet that really makes sense.

To ensure I don't forget it, and have time for it to "really sink in"; I have a series of recurring reflection notifications in my calendar. I have a 30min slot once a week (usually set to about the time I'm coming home on the train) where the interesting points are noted straight away in the notes field. 

When "Reflection" pops up, the points I wish to reflect on are also shown.... It gives me a good 15 or so minutes to sit and think about those points and how I could have better implemented those in the previous day(s). As one last little point, I've found setting four different reflection appointments set to, for example, 1st Monday of the month / 2nd Tuesday of the month and so on - works best. This makes sure I don't always skip as I may have a period where something's always on that day of the week, and secondly I can spread the reflection points across four different sets allowing me to not always be focusing on the same points.

### Podcasts
I travel A LOT - public transport to work each day and international travel most weeks. I really enjoy reading, but sometimes find after the end of a long day I just don't have the energy to do it. I've found that for me here're some really interesting podcasts out there that are automatically downloaded and on my phone ready. If you're on Android I can really recommend [Podcast Addict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict&hl=en) as its free and does everything you could ask for.

I would also strongly recommend the following podcasts to follow:

* Aviation Week Check 6 - Great weekly source of aviation news
* HBR IdeaCast - Topics coming from Harvard Business Review. A lot of it's not for me - but there's usually at least one or two casts that are really interesting. Worth having a look through every now and then.
* Manager Tools - Can be a little long winded at times, but the general topics are usually interesting and helpful to reflect on how you would handle particular situations.
* The Economist Editors Picks - Great weekly source of current affairs

### Email Follow Up
I get flooded (I'm sure like everyone) with email each day and really find it next to impossible to manage without a solid system. What I've found is that setting the following folder structure allows me to quickly sort my mail for easier prioritisation and keep my inbox to a manageable level.

I then set up the following rule. This basically means that if I have an email that I want to remember and follow up on then I add myself in the BCC field and it automatically adds a copy to the waiting folder and sets a task with a reminder for one week later. This is my absolute saviour, as it means I rarely forget to follow up on items.

I then also set up the following quick rules. For those who don't use them it basically allows you to right-click on an item and automatically add it to one of my folders and add an action / reminder where appropriate. It makes sorting through emails even easier.

So again, I hope you found at least one of these little points interesting, and if you've got anything yourself then please drop me a line and share.

Cheers
