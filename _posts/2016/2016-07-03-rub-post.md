My original dry rub recipe was on a piece of paper in my recipe book that seems to have magically disappeared... Kids were playing with the book sometime ago, so I'm assuming it ended up being used as a coloring page or whatnot. I've tried to recreate the recipe as best I can from memory - will likely have to go through a few versions again before I'm happy with it.

* 2 Tablespoons - Salt
* 1 Tablespoon - Ground Rosmary
* 1 Tablespoon - Onion Powder
* 1 Tablespoon - Garlic Poweder
* 1 Tablespoon - Ginger Powder
* 4 Tablespoons - Smoked Paprika
* 1/2 Tablespoon - Cayenne Pfeffer
* 1/2 Tablespoon - Black Pepper
* 3 Tablespoons - Sugar

Mix them all together and you're done - As said above, Ill likely make some updates on this one as time goes by...

Cheers
