MAPLE BACON JAM RECIPE

There is quite a lot of recipes on the web, i browsed a few, made note of the main ingredients and started to put it all together. I have been making this jam for the last few years. Goes great on burgers, eggs, cheese and biscuits, pretty much everything  

Ingredients:

500gm Streaky Bacon (rindless)
1 large Brown Onion 
1/4 cup Brown Sugar
2 tsp Minced Garlic
1/4 tsp Cayenne Powder
1/2 tsp Cinnamon
1/2 tsp Nutmeg
1/2 cup Bourbon
1/2 cup Vinegar
1/4 cup Black Coffee (tsp coffee, hot water)
1/2 cup Maple Syrup
Tomato Sauce

Start by dicing up all the bacon and browning.

Once that is done, slice the onion very thinly and add to bacon. 

Continue to cook on low heat until onion is soft and translucent.

Add the brown sugar and wait until the mixture is nice and caramelised.

Now the garlic and spices go on, another 5 minutes or so.

Add bourbon, vinegar, coffee and syrup and bring to the boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 30-40 minutes until it all thickens, keep an eye on it, so that it does not burn or dry out.

Once a desired consistency, add a touch of tomato sauce, heat for another 5 minutes and then you are done.
