Its been a while now since we made the decision to shutdown our startup Weave and call it a day. I had lost the drive and the passion for the business when I saw that the end was near and I didn't have the energy to even think about it. 

The mourning has gone on long enough though now, and for the first time I can actually sit down and reflect on the causes and discuss it a little. This post will act as some self-venting, lessons learned and above all a chance to capture some experience. Because as they say - experience is simply the name we give our mistakes.

Weave was a web app where people shared truly special moments. Our thoughts were that the vast majority of content shared on social media is largely only "noise" - as there is no barrier to entry people largely flood their feeds with uneventful content. Originally after seeing [love locks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_lock) on a bridge here in Hamburg, It struck me that what's enjoyable here is not necessarily the individual messages on each lock, but instead how all these special moments interacted together to create something bigger. It was with this in mind that the idea for Weave was born. 

Users paid a small price to add a thread (post) to Weave. Firstly the idea was this would address our business model, and secondly also ensure higher level content was posted while giving an element of value/exclusivity if someone posted something. Your “thread” was a post which is colored based on its emotional quality and contained a unique message, title, icon and uploaded image which empowered users to share meaningful moments and messages with the whole world. An algorithm was behind the interface detecting correlations and connecting peoples threads that shared underlying similarities.

We wanted to bring the novelty of exploration to the end user, but with their story always at the center. As people today search for content or drill down in folder like structures; Weave was designed to find underlying correlations and allow people to explore content via a graphical interface that is more organic than hierarchical (to the extent there was no search box!) We really wanted to reproduce that feeling of randomly walking in a new city and stumbling upon something you were never looking for.

The unique selling point was that we were the first to market with an interface that's totally different to current platforms. This interface would serve as a strong "novelty" factor and by ensuring higher quality content people would enjoy exploring through in short bursts. By nature, the platform was designed for short term interaction/entertainment - perfectly suited to 15-25 year olds.

So with all that said - what went wrong? After looking through it, I think it was a combination of things, but will try to summarise as follows:

* Listen To The People That Pay

Hype made us think that we were doing well as a company, it made us feel like we were "on our way". While the hype around Weave paled in comparison to what other startups experience in terms of PR and word-of-mouth, we were still deceived by the fact that almost everyone that heard the idea for the first time seemed to love it. But I quickly learned that hype doesn’t equal traction. It really doesn’t matter how excited a friend-of-a-friend got about Weave unless they became a paying customer. Only pay attention to people that invest a lot of time using your product or pay. Ignore the hype, it doesn’t mean you’re doing well.

* Truly Understand Your Customer

We worked hard on the proof of technical part of the business, but we skimped on the idea validation/customer steps. When we started our business, we knew very little about how it would operate. So we turned to developing solutions as that's what we knew and felt comfortable with (we are Engineers after all!) Instead we should've been out there interviewing more of those 15-25 year olds. Finding out why they were using Snapchat instead of Facebook and why they would (or wouldn't) pay 99c for a thread. We made too many assumptions on our customers based on a limited set of information. Don’t start to brainstorm on the value prop of your product until you’re 100% sure that you’re building something that people actually want.

* Stay Flexible

In an early product phase, try to reach product market fit first. Take short-cuts. Do things that don’t scale. Do things manually. Premature optimization binds resources that could deliver more direct customer value. Ask yourself whether you rather want a working business model that does not scale yet, or whether you want to scale a business model/product that doesn’t work. As the team was all largely engineers we have a natural tendency to do things "right" - we spent much MUCH too long on the backend ensuring stability instead of spending time with the customers. 

* Fail Fast

An oldy but a goody - Fail fast and fail cheap. While we were tempted to bring in additional developers to solve some more points, we ultimately decided that our time was too valuable to waste on a bad idea. The worst case scenario isn’t failing. The worst case scenario is to spend your prime years on something that isn’t working. If you must fail, fail fast and fail cheap. Don’t run a zombie company.

So with that, all said, finally, I will say that failure in general (particularly having to wind down a startup) is really rough. Once you get through the sadness, anxiety, whatever it may be though, I can only recommend taking the time to sit down with a strong single malt and think: “What would I have done differently?”.
