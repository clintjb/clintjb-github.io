My original dry rub recipes were on scraps of paper in my recipe book - after one seemed to have magically disappeared (Kids were playing with the book sometime ago, so I'm assuming it ended up being used as a coloring page or whatnot) I've decided perhaps its best to simply reccreate it from mememory, and back the rest up here.
