Hi I'm Clint,

A 30 something year old outspoken father, husband, lean enthusiast and aspiring chef. I'm originally from Australia but was roped into now living in Hamburg Germany. I love to try and break things down as clean and simple as possible. To better understand whats going on at the working level, and more importantly what brings the benefit for the end product. 

In my spare time I'm also the co-founder of [Weave](http://www.weave.ws). We've tried to develop something that allows the user to unexpectedly find and deeply connect with content that has a purpose; our ultimate goal is to help users explore and share meaningful moments through their social network. 

Be it working on mastering a new recipe in the kitchen or driving operational improvements in business - Adding to an efficient, valued end product is where my true passion lies. I've set this blog up to act mainly just as a repository of stuff I find interesting - hopefully others find it the same as well. If you would like to connect with me or just have a chat about anything, then feel free to have a look around and get in touch.

Cheers,
